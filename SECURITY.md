## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, **please do not create a public issue**. Instead, report it privately by emailing:

**kalfasyan+security@gmail.com**

Please include as much detail as possible to help us quickly understand and address the issue. I will respond as soon as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure process as appropriate.

- I appreciate responsible disclosure.
- After a fix is released, I will credit reporters (if desired) in the release notes.

For more information, see [GitHub's documentation on coordinated disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/creating-a-security-advisory).
